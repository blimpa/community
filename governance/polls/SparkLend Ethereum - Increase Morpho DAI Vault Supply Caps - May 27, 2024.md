# Poll: SparkLend Ethereum - Increase Morpho DAI Vault Supply Caps - May 27, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Scope Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 27 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

Supply caps limit the Facilitators' ability to mint more DAI into the market. The Morpho Spark DAI vault recently filled the existing 50 million DAI supply cap for the sUSDe 91.5% LLTV pool. Given Ethenaâ€™s recent change in sUSDe rate calculations, which resulted in increased yield and collateral demand, Phoenix Labs and [BA Labs](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/may-21-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24327/2) recommend increasing the allocation to the sUSDe 91.5% and 86% LLTV pools over time. 
The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes to SparkLend on Ethereum mainnet:

- Increasing the supply cap of the sUSDe 91.5% LLTV pool from 50 million DAI to **100 million DAI**.
- Increasing the supply cap of the sUSDe 86% LLTV pool from 200 million DAI to **400 million DAI**.

This will allow for a total allocation of up to 500 million DAI to sUSDe collateralized pools, with a weighted average LTV of ~87.1%, if fully utilized.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/may-21-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24327) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to increase the sUSDe 91.5% LLTV pool supply cap to 100 million DAI and the sUSDe 86% LLTV pool supply cap to 200 million DAI on SparkLend Ethereum.
- An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
- It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
