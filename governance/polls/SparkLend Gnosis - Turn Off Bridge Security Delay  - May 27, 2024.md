# Poll: SparkLend Gnosis - Turn Off Bridge Security Delay  - May 27, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Scope Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 27 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

Phoenix Labs proposes to remove the 2-day delay for SparkLend's governance on Gnosis as it provides no additional protection, but impedes the speed of governance actions. 
The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes to SparkLend on Gnosis:

- Lowering the security delay for SparkLend governance on Gnosis from 2 days to **0 days**.
- Setting the minimum security delay limit to **0**.

[BA Labs confirms](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/may-21-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24327/2) that removing the delay will not impact the risk profile of the Gnosis market.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/may-21-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24327) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to lower the security delay for Spark governance to 0 days and to set the minimum security delay limit to 0 on Gnosis.
- An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
